<h1> What is slide in the woods? </h1>

<p> Slide in the Woods is a groundbreaking indie horror game that shook the world of video games to
it's core. With cutting edge mechanics and an avant garde narrative with obvious inspirations from the
likes of of Dostoevsky and Rushdie; Slide in the Woods is truly a post modern classic which induced a cultural shift from "antique
horrors" (ghost, vampires, the supernatural) to a focus in media on the fears of the modern, skeptical man. </p>

<h1> What is speedrunning </h1>

<p> Speedrunning is the art of beating a video game as fast as possible. Alot of the fun
comes from finding bugs and loopsholes in the games design that allow me to beat the game faster
than the developers ever could have imagined. I dedicated my entire life to this. </p>
